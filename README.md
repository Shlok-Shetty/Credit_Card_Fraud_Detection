## Project Overview

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project aims to build a robust machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time. With the increasing reliance on credit cards for online and offline transactions, the threat of fraud has grown significantly, posing risks to both consumers and financial institutions. This project addresses the critical need for effective fraud detection systems to mitigate these risks.

### Dataset
The project utilizes the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** available on Kaggle, which consists of 284,807 transactions made by credit cards in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only **492 transactions** classified as fraudulent, representing approximately **0.172%** of the total dataset. The dataset includes the following features:

- **Time**: Number of seconds elapsed since the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1 to V28**: These are the result of a PCA transformation that anonymizes the actual features to protect user privacy.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: The label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

### Objectives
The primary objectives of the project are to:
1. **Identify Fraudulent Transactions**: Develop models that accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on the features provided.
2. **Handle Imbalanced Data**: Implement techniques to manage the class imbalance present in the dataset, ensuring that the model is not biased toward predicting the majority class.
3. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Use various evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the models in distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

### Methodology
The project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features to prepare for model training.
2. **Model Selection and Training**: Utilizing various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to train models on the processed data.
3. **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Applying techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to create a balanced dataset for training.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to understand the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.

### Impact
By accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance security in financial transactions. The insights gained from model evaluations can inform further improvements and refinements in fraud detection systems.

Through this project, we demonstrate the practical application of machine learning techniques in a real-world scenario, showcasing the importance of data-driven decision-making in combating fraud.
